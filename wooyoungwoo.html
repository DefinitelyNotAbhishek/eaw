    <h1><b>Woo Young Woo</b></h1>
    <br>
    Woo Young-woo is a young Korean girl on the autism spectrum who has yet to speak, despite consultations with specialists.
    Her first words finally come when she witnesses her father being attacked by a jealous husband/neighbor.
    In the heat of the moment, Young-woo begins loudly citing legal definitions of various degrees of physical assault that she
    has memorized from her father's legal library, verbatim. This launches her in the direction of a legal career.
    We next see Young-woo as she begins her first day at the Hanbada law firm after graduating at the top of her class at Seoul National University.
   She is assigned to the team of senior attorney Jung Myung-seok, who does not want the awkward newcomer on his team.
  He gets assurances from CEO Han Seon-young that he can dismiss Young-woo if she mishandles her first case.
  This turns out to be an assault case of a wife on her husband.
  It is set to be plea bargained with a guilty plea to attempted murder with only a sentence of probation.
  Young-woo correctly points out that such a plea would invalidate the woman's pension, leaving her destitute.
  In court, Young-woo extracts testimony from a medical expert that the husband could have been rendered unconscious
  by an underlying subdural hematoma on his brain and not any physical blows, of which there were no physical symptoms.
  The court agrees to reduce the charge to assault
